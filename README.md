## About our Model:

asd

### How to use this Model:

**Testing and Simulation**

**Modes**

Our Model can be used in two different modes. There is a manual mode, where the user can input specific 

---
## Input Parameters:
We used the following input parameters in our model:


+ **Wind Data**

   Wind Data is fed into our model in raster format and taken from [here].(insert link here!)  
   We used two seperate Inputs, one for lat(u)-winds and one for lng(v)-winds.  
   

+ **Time**

   Time is defined as steps, which in turn represent iterations. Each step represents 6 hours and one model iteration.  
   This was derived from how often atmospheric winds are measured, which is in 6-hour intervalls.  
   

+ **Resolution**

   With this parameter, the pixel-resolution (in km units) of our model can be changed.  
   
   
+ **Location of Volcano**

   The location of a volcano can be entered here.  
   This parameters takes coordinates in the lng/lat format (in decimal degrees).  
   

+ **Ash Plume height**

   asdfasdf.  
   asdfasdf.  

+ **Mass- and Volume Rates & Ash Fraction**

   asdfasdf.  
   asdfasdf.
